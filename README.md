# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains the Assignments I completed for the machine learning online course provided by Stanford on Coursera. It covers the following main topics:
* **Supervised Learning**
    * Multivariate Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression (including Multiclass Classification, Support Vector Machine)
    * Neural Networks
* **Unsupervised Learning**
    * K-Means Algorithm
    * Anomaly Detection
* **Others**
    * Evaluating a Learning Algorithm
    * Data Compression and Visualization
    * Principal Component Analysis
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent
    * Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
    * etc.

## Getting Started

The following are the steps to run these applications in this repository on your local computer.

### Prerequisites

All applications in this repository are run on [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Please follow the [instruction](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) to install Octave on your local computer.

After Octave is successfully installed, you can run octave by entering the following in your shell:

```
user$ Octave
```

To exit Octave, please entre the following:

```
octave:1> exit
```

## Running the tests

The following are all executable files to run the application in each folder:

* linear-regression - ex1.m and ex1_multi.m
* logistic-regression - ex2.m and ex2_reg.m
* neural-network - ex3.m and ex3_nn.m
* nn-backpropagation - ex4.m
* algorithm-evaluation - ex5.m
* support-vector-machine - ex6.m and ex6_spam.m
* Kmeans-clustering-with-PCA - ex7.m and ex7_pca.m
* anomaly-detection - ex8.m
* recommender-systems - ex8_cofi.m

To run the application, for example, please entre:

```
octave:1> ex1.m
```
